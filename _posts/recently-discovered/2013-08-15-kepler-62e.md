Due to the detection method used, few properties of the planet are known other than its orbit and mass.

It orbits Tau Ceti at a distance of 0.552 AU (between the orbits of Venus and Mercury in the Solar System) with an orbital period of 168 days and has a minimum mass of 4.3 Earth masses. Because the minimum mass of a super-Earth is 5 Earth masses,[3] Tau Ceti e is classified as being Earth sized.
